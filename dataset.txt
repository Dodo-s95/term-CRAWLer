with O
two O
propulsive O
phases O

a O
pull I

The O

of O
her O

mass I
was O
calculated O
and O
plotted O
for O
her O
left B
arm I

. O
<eos> O
The O
first O
propulsive B
phase I
, O
the O

, O
occurs O
as O
she O
flexes O
her O

brings O
her O

her O

Let O
describe O
the O

Consequently O
, O
the O
velocity B

observed O
at O
the O

<eos> O
is O
the O

her O

. O
<eos> O
Her O
forward B

decelerates O
after O
her O

the O

it O

<eos> O
I O
first O
learned O
that O
some O
backstroke I
swimmers O
were O
using O
a O
final B
upsweep I
for O
propulsion I
when O
a O
group I
I O
was O
working O
with O

analyzed O
the O

of O
Jesse O
Vassallo O
, O
a O
member I
of O
the O
1984 O
U.S. O
Olympic O
swim B
team I
in O
the O
200 O
m O
backstroke I
. O
<eos> O
I O
was O
surprised O
to O
see O
that O
he O
swam O
with O
his O
arm O
extended O
for O
most O
of O
his O
underwater B
arm I
stroke I
. O
<eos> O
Initially O
, O
I O
thought I
this O
was O
a O
huge O
stroke I
error I
and O
marveled O
that O
he O
was O
able O
to O
qualify O
for O
the O
Olympic O
team I
in O
spite I
of O
it O
. O
<eos> O
That O
all O
changed O
when O
we O
developed O
a O
propulsion I
graph I
for O
him O
. O
<eos> O
That O
graph I
is O
shown O
in O
figure I
5 O
. O
<eos> O
The O
unit O
of O
measurement I
is O
propulsive B
force I
, O
not O
forward B
velocity I
, O
because O
that O
was O
the O
way O
we O
were O
measuring O
propulsion I
at O
that O
time I
. O
<eos> O
You O
can O
assume O
, O
however O
, O
that O
increases O
of O
propulsive B
force I
also O
indicate O
greater O
forward B
velocity I
. O
<eos> O
The O
graph I
begins O
at O
point I

where O
his O
right O
hand I
enters O
the O

the O

and O
it O
reached O
the O

<eos> O
The O
negative O
propulsive B

that O
he O
was O
actually O
losing O

the O
interval O

<eos> O
The O

with O

occurred O
after O
it O
had O
traveled O
down O

out O
for O
a O
short B
period I
of I

and O
was O
in O

<eos> O
His O

was O
very O

little O

( O

because O
his O

almost O

<eos> O
As O
I O
mentioned O
earlier I

from O
the O

he O
appeared O
to O
be O
stroking O

a O
straight B

showed O
a O
slight I

of O
his O

. O
<eos> O
He O
exerted O
less O
propulsive B
force I
during O
the O
downsweep I
than O
he O
had O
during O
the O
previous O
upsweep I
, O
therefore O
, O
his O
forward B
velocity I
probably O
decreased O
during O
that O
portion O
of O
his O

<eos> O
While O

he O

with O
a O
long I
, O
upward O
movement I
of O
his O
extended B
arm I
that O
was O
done O
similar I
to O
the O
way O
in O
which O
Zubero O
executed O
his O
final B
upsweep I
( O

) O
. O
<eos> O
Vassallo O

force I
graph I
indicated O
, O
to O
me O
, O
that O
backstroke I
swimmers O
should O
be O
capable I
of O
achieving O
three O
propulsive O
peaks O
during O
an O
underwater B
arm I
stroke I
; O
a O
notion I
, O
that O
was O
later O
confirmed O
by O
center B
of I
mass I
forward B
velocity I
analyses O
of O
Martin O
Zubero O
and O
Jeff O
Rouse O
( O

, O

) O
. O
<eos> O
I O
included O
the O
graph I
in O
figure I
5 O
, O
as O
evidence I
that O
the O
final B
upsweep I
can O
be O
very O
propulsive O
. O
<eos> O
This O
may O
be O
because O
swimmers O
are O
able O
to O
make O
a O
large B
paddle I
with O
their O
hand I
and O
arm O
to O
push I
back I
against O
the O
water I
It O
may O
also O
be O
that O
they O
are O
able O
to O
generate O
greater O
velocity I
with O
their O
hand I
, O
and O
thus O
, O
greater O
power I
, O
when O
their O
arm O
is O
extended O
instead O
of O
flexed O
. O
<eos> O
This O
is O
very O
likely O
because O
the O
hand I
would O
be O
further O
from O
the O
shoulder I
, O
which O
is O
the O
center B
of I
rotation I
for O
the O
arm O
. O
<eos> O
Let O
me O
describe O
some O
other O
aspects O
of O
the O
three-peak O
backstroke I
that O
differ O
from O
the O
traditional O
two-peak O
stroke I
. O
<eos> O
This O
will O
be O
done O
using O
side I
and O
front I
views O
of O
Martin O
Zubero O

<eos> O

pattern I

in O

<eos> O
The O
first O
item I
I O
want O
to O
discuss O
is O
the O
depth I
of O
the O
swimmer I
’s O
arm O
when O
he O
makes O
the O
catch I
. O
<eos> O
Not O
so O
very O
long I
ago O
, O
conventional B
wisdom I
was O
that O
backstrokers O
should O
sweep I
their O
hand I
down O
fairly I
deep I
in O
the O
water I
before O
making O
the O
catch I
. O
<eos> O
Swimmers O
were O
generally I
taught O
to O
turn I
their O
palms O
down O
toward O
the O
bottom I
of O
the O
pool I
during O
this O
motion I
( O
see O
photo I
on O
the O
left I
in O
figure I
7 O
) O
. O
<eos> O
This O
type B
of I
catch I
was O
in O
vogue I
when O
we O
thought I
sculling O
was O
the O
preferred B
method I
of I
propulsion I
. O
<eos> O
The O
belief I
was,(1 O
) O
that O
a O
deep B
catch I
would O
allow O
for O
a O
longer I
and O
more O
propulsive B
upsweep I
and O
, O
( O
2 O
) O
that O
it O
encouraged O
backstrokers O
to O
roll O
from O
side I
to O
side I
and O
thus O
, O
travel I
through O
the O
water B
with I
less I
drag I
. O

immediately I

the O

<eos> O
However O
, O

that O
elite B

wait O
until O

in O
a O

<eos> O
This O
suggests O
that O
backstroke I
swimmers O
take O
the O
time I
to O
flex I
their O

it O
so O
they O

<eos> O
The O
upsweep I
in O
backstroke I
is O
an O
example O
of O
the O
same O
shoulder I
adducting O
movement I
I O
described O
in O
an O
earlier I
paper I
for O
the O
breaststroke I

butterfly B

<eos> O
Backstroke O
swimmers O

their O

almost O
horizontally I
back I
against O
the O
water I
with O
the O
hand I
traveling O
up O
only O
a O
small B
amount I
due O
to O
rotation O
of O
the O
arm O
at O
the O
shoulder B
joint I
. O
<eos> O
This O
is O
probably O
because O
stroking O
back I
more O
enables O
backstroke I
swimmers O
to O
exert O
propulsive B
force I
against O
the O
water I
with O
both O
their O
upper O
and O
lower O
arms O
, O
as O

one O
important B
difference I

the O
shoulder-adducting O
upsweep I

the O

almost O

. O
<eos> O
Most O
modern-day O
backstrokers O
make O
the O
catch I
with O
their O
arm O
out O
to O
the O
side I
more O
and O
they O
have O
eliminated O
the O

portion O

the O

<eos> O
Although O

At O

<eos> O
Backstrokers O

<eos> O
A O

that O

<eos> O
Accordingly O
, O
as O

they O

In O

often O

, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
ability I

hyperextend O

to O
that O
of O
Zubero O
at O
this O

<eos> O
The O
fact I
that O
their O

quite O
deep I
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
downsweep I
with O
their O
wrists O

they O

to O
apply O

force I
as O
it O
travels O
up O

<eos> O
You O
would O
expect O
that O

completely I
so O
early I

so O
deep I

if O

not O
going O

something O

<eos> O
It O
would O
be O
more O
efficient I
to O
finish I
the O

later O
, O
with O
their O
arm O
at O
their O

reduce O
the O

bring O
it O

ways O

<eos> O
Some O
thoughts O
on O
the O
three-peak O
backstroke I
. O
<eos> O
I O
think O
a O
backstroke I
that O
is O
swum O
with O
three-peaks O
could O
be O
superior I
to O
a O
two-peak O
style I
for O
several O
reasons O
. O
<eos> O
These O
involve O
the O
propulsive B
force I
that O
can O
be O
generated O
during O
the O
final B
upsweep B
or I
inward I
scull I
as O
well O
as O
the O
way O
it O
encourages O
a O
different O
and O
better O
timing O
for O
the O
arm B
stroke I
. O
<eos> O
Nevertheless O
, O
the O
average B
velocity I
per O
arm B
stroke I
and O
the O
distance I
traveled O
are O
the O
key O
components O
of O
fast B
swimming I
. O
<eos> O
Any O
method I
, O
whether O
it O
be O
the O
addition I
of O
a O
third O
propulsive B
peak I
, O
an O
increase I
in O
the O
velocity I
of O
one O
or O
both O
of O
the O
two O
traditional O
propulsive O
peaks O
, O
or O
an O
increase I
in O
the O
length I
of O
one O
or O
both O
of O
those O
propulsive O
peaks O
should O
improve O
a O
swimmer I
’s O
performance I
markedly I
. O
<eos> O
That O
said O
, O
it O
seems O
probable I
that O
greater O
stroke B
length B
and I
average I
velocity I
per O
stroke I
are O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
achieved O
through O
the O
addition I
of O
a O
third O
propulsive B
peak I
, O
especially O
one O
that O
has O
the O
potential I
to O
increase I
forward B
velocity I
to O
a O
greater O
extent I
than O
the O
traditional B

Let O

the O
potential I
advantages O
of O
the O
three-peak O
backstroke I
in O

detail I

<eos> O
The O
unique B
style I
of O
the O
final B

may O
increase I
velocity I
more O
than O
the O
traditional B
upsweep I

. O
<eos> O
All O
of O
the O
forward B
velocity I
graphs O
that O
are O
available O
for O
three-peak O
world-class O
backstrokers O
during O
competition I
demonstrate O
that O
they O
achieve O
a O
greater O
forward B
velocity I
during O
the O
final B
upsweep I
than O
they O
do O
during O
the O
preceding B

did O
not O
exceed O
1.8 O

<eos> O
at O
any O
other O
time I
. O
<eos> O
Although O
data I
from O
only O
two O
subjects O
is O
far O
from O
compelling I
, O
they O
suggest O
the O
possibility I
that O
pushing O

the O
water I

an O
extended B
arm I
during O
the O
final B
upsweep B
or I
inward I
scull I

may O
be O

the O

the O

This O

Regardless O

this O

<eos> O
In O
my O
opinion I

the O
fact I
that O
a O
smaller O

using O

like O
the O

not O
disqualify O
his O
style I
as O
potentially I
the O
most O
effective I
way O
to O
swim I
a O
three-peak O
backstroke I
. O
<eos> O
It O
is O
very O
likely O
that O
the O
traditional O
two-peak O
style I
that O
most O
backstrokers O
are O
taught O
at O
a O
young B
age I
has O
discouraged O
many O
from O
developing O
a O
longer I
final B
upsweep I
and O
, O
consequently O
, O
a O
higher O
average B
velocity I
per O
stroke B
cycle I
. O
<eos> O
Nevertheless O
, O
what O
was O
just O
said O
is O
entirely O
speculation I
on O
my O
part I
and O
not O
proof I
that O
a O
long B
final I
upsweep I
should O
be O
adopted O
without O
a O
period B
of I
trial I

. O
<eos> O
If O
you O
wish O
to O
attempt I
swimming I
a O
three-peak O
backstroke I
with O
a O
long B
final I
upsweep I
, O
there O
appear O
to O
be O
two O
general I
ways O
it O
can O
be O
done O
. O
<eos> O
The O
first O
method I
, O
as O
displayed O
in O
Zubero O
’s O
and O
Vassallo O
’s O
forward B
velocity I
graphs O
, O
( O
see O
figures O
5 O
and O

is O
to O
sacrifice O
propulsion I
during O
the O
downsweep I
by O
abbreviating O
that O
sweep I
in O
favor I
of O
a O
longer I
final B
upsweep I
. O
<eos> O
The O
second O
method I
, O
that O
some O
appear O
to O
be O
using O
, O
is O
to O
abbreviate O
or O
eliminate O
the O
upsweep I
in O
favor I
of O
a O
longer I
downsweep I
and O
a O
longer I
final B
upsweep I
. O
<eos> O
Both O
of O
these O
methods O
were O
described O
earlier I
. O
<eos> O
Of O
course O
, O
the O
flip O
side I
to O
this O
argument I
would O
be O
that O
a O
swimmer I
who O
executes O
the O
first O
two O
sweeps O
reasonably O
well O
, O
while O
using O
a O
short I
, O
highly I
propulsive O
inward O
scull I
during O
the O
third O
propulsive B
phase I
of O
the O
underwater B
arm I
stroke I
might O
be O
more O
likely O
to O
achieve O
greater O
stroke B
length I
and O
greater O
average B
velocity I
per O
stroke I
than O
one O
who O
abbreviates O
the O
upsweep I
or O
downsweep I
in O
order I
to O
gain I
a O
longer I
final B
upsweep I
. O
<eos> O
The O
only O
way O
to O
determine O
which O
style I
might O
be O
more O
successful I
for O
a O
particular O
swimmer I
is O
through O
testing I
and O
trial I
and O
error I
. O
<eos> O
The O
use O
of O
a O
final B
upsweep B
or I
inward I
scull I
may O
allow O
swimmers O
to O
use O
a O
higher O
stroke B
rate I
in O
races O
. O
<eos> O
The O
final B
upsweep I
/ O
inward O
scull I
is O
executed O
with O
a O
straight B
arm I
, O
therefore O
, O
as O
indicated O
earlier I
, O
greater O
hand I
velocity I
can O
be O
attained O
during O
that O
portion O
of O
the O
arm B
stroke I
, O
This O
should O
, O
in O
turn I
, O
result I
in O
a O
faster I
stroke B
rate I
and O
, O
greater O
forward B
velocity I
. O

<eos> O

it O
could O
be O
argued O
that O
today I

world-class O
100 O
m O
backstroke I
swimmers O
are O
stroking O
faster I
because O
they O
catch I
earlier I
and O
do O
not O
sweep I
their O
hand I
up O
very O
much O
during O
the O
upsweep I
, O

, O
because O
they O
spend O
more O
time I
kicking O
underwater B
and I
less I
time I
swimming I
on O
the O
surface I
. O
<eos> O
These O
technique I
changes O
probably O
do O
account I
for O
the O
fact I
that O
backstrokers O
have O
been O
able O
to O
increase I
their O
stroke I
rates O
with O
no O
significant B
loss I
of I
stroke I
length I
. O
<eos> O
Nevertheless O
, O
the O
higher O
strokes O
rates O
of O
modern-day O
swimmers O
could O
also O
be O
a O
result I
, O
at O
least O
in O
part I
, O
of O
greater O
hand I

because O
more O
are O
using O

<eos> O
What O
can O

be O

why O

The O

backstroke I
may O
be O
more O
continuous I
than O
the O
two-peak O
style I
. O
<eos> O
Another O
possible O
advantage I
in O
favor I
of O
a O
three-peak O
backstroke I
may O
be O
that O
swimmers O
decelerate O
less O
between O

<eos> O
In O
the O

the O

the O

that O
it O

The O

most O
of O
this O
period I
and O
, O
with O
only O
the O
kick I
for O
propulsion I
, O
the O
swimmer I
’s O
body I
will O
decelerate O
rapidly I
so O
that O
the O

may O
be O
in O
excess I
of O
0.6 O

that O
both O
the O
length B

the O
loss B
of I
velocity I
between O
strokes O
can O
be O
shortened O
considerably O
by O

<eos> O
Swimmers O

<eos> O
Consequently O
, O
the O
addition I

should O
shorten O
the O

decelerate O

In O

be O
able O
to O
maintain O
a O
