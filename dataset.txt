Initially B

I O
thought O
this O
was O
a O
huge O

error B

marveled O
that O
he O

it O

all O

be O

This O

be O
because O

the O
depth B

when O

"
" 
Not O
so O
very O
long B

, O
conventional B
wisdom I
was O
that O
backstrokers O
should O
sweep B
their O
hand B
down O
fairly B
deep B
in O
the O
water B
before O
making O
the O
catch B

"

generally B

to O
turn B
their O

this O

( O

"
" 
This O
type B
of I
catch I
was O
in O
vogue B
when O
we O
thought O
sculling B
was O
the O
preferred B
method I
of I
propulsion I
. O
"
" 
The O
belief B
was,(1 O
) O
that O
a O
deep B
catch I
would O
allow O
for O
a O
longer B
and O
more O
propulsive B
upsweep I
and O
, O
( O
2 O
) O
that O
it O
encouraged O
backstrokers O
to O
roll O
from O
side B
to O
side B

thus O
, O
travel B
through O
the O
water B

less I
